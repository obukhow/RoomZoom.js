= First Ever Zoom Image Plugin for Prototype Framework =

Based on jQzoom Evolution Library v2.3 by Marco Renzi (http://www.mind-projects.it). Licensed under the BSD license. This module uses Prototype javascript Framework to create amazing zooming effects such as popup zoom, inner image zoom, zoom with reverse opacity and zoom in drag mode. Unlike other plugins RoomZoom.js can use smoothing motion effect with customisable speed. You can easily combine multiple images to a gallery. And you can use multiple galleries on a one page specifing which gallery each image belongs to. RoomZoom.js is very configurable and customisable with many available parameters.

== Demo ==

To see a demo please visit [[http://obukhow.github.com/RoomZoom.js/|github demo page]].

== Installation ==

To use this script, please add prototype library to your header. All animation effectes use Scruptacolous, so you must also add this library.

            <script type='text/javascript' src='js/prototype.js'></script>
            <script type='text/javascript' src='js/roomzoom.js'></script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="http://script.aculo.us/scriptaculous.js"></script>

Add roomzoom.css to your header.

            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="roomzoom.css">

== How to use ==

Using RoomZoom is easy,but you need to specify the HTML anchor element,that is going to generate the zoom revealing a portion of the enlarged image.

            <a href="images/BIGIMAGE.JPG" class="MYCLASS" title="MYTITLE">
            <img src="images/SMALLIMAGE.JPG" title="IMAGE TITLE">
            </a>

The anchor element wraps the small image you would like to zoom.Following this schema the necessary and base elements are:

* SMALLIMAGE.JPG: Represents the small image you would like to zoom.
* BIGIMAGE.JPG: Represents the big image that RoomZoom will reveal.
* MYCLASS: Represents the anchor class,that would be used to instantiate the RoomZoom script to all the elements matching this class(you can use an ID as well).
* MYTITLE/IMAGE TITLE: Anchor title and/or image title that will be used to show the zoom title close to the RoomZoom Window.
* PAY ATTENTION: The SMALLIMAGE must be a scaled versione of the BIGIMAGE.

Now load the plugin at window load.

            document.observe('dom:loaded', function(){
                zoom = new RoomZoom($('zoomer'));
            });

This will instantiate RoomZoom in default(standard) mode.You can pass more options(Documentation section),to create special or custom effects as in the example below.

            document.observe('dom:loaded', function(){
                zoom = new RoomZoom($('zoomer'), {
                    alwaysOn : false,
                    zoomWidth: 250,
                    zoomHeight:200,
                    position:'left',
                    xOffset: 30,
                    yOffset:80,
                    zoomType: 'revrse'
                    // More Options
                    ...
                });
            });

=== Galleries and Thumbnails ===

If you want to create galleries, RoomZoom.js can manage it for you.

Attach the gallery ID to your main anchor "rel" attribute.

            <a href="BIGIMAGE.JPG" class="MYCLASS" title="MYTITLE" rel="gal1">  
                <img src="SMALLIMAGE.JPG" title="IMAGE TITLE">  
            </a>
                
Manage your thumbnails "class" and "rel" attributes. The class "zoomThumbActive" is attached to your thumbnails by RoomZoom.js. By default specify this class to the selected thumbnail (it should be the same image in your main anchor element)

            <a class="zoomThumbActive" href="LARGEIMAGE1.jpg" rel="gallery:gal1" rev="SMALLIMAGE1.jpg">  
                <img src="thumbs/THUMBIMG1.jpg">  
            </a>
                
The structure of the thumbnail rel attribute is very important. The base elements are
*gallery: the ID of the gallery to which it belongs.
*smallimage: the path to the SMALLIMAGE to be loaded on the when you click on the thumbnail.
*largeimage: the path to the LARGEIMAGE.
